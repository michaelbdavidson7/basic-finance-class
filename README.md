# Basic Finances class outline

Why do high schools and colleges require tough, esoteric math classes, but not basic finances? Few students know how to responsibly manage their money and get taken advantage of, but they know how to solve for `x` on a triangle! 

My belief is that all schools should adopt some form of a basic finance class into their required cirriculum, even over other traditionally offered math classes. These ideas are very important for lower-middle class students to learn so that they can manage their money without paying for mistakes/paying for assistance. 

Creating more financially independent people can improve lives and even the national economy!

This project is public domain and anyone can contribute and/or use this cirriculum for any purpose. I chose to host this on Github because the path to collaboration is very well defined (see [Github Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)). The goal of this project is to create a syllabus and lesson plan that any teacher around the world can pick up, and tweak it to their needs. 

**Goal**: To teach the basics of personal finance in a practical and also technical way. 

**Open questions that we want to answer:**
* What is an emergency fund?
  * The first thing someone should do is put away a fund (e.g. $10k) as an emergency fund 
* How expensive of an apartment/mortgage can I afford? 
  * The 40x rule - You can afford a monthly rent that is (your yearly salary/40). For example, if the rent is $2,000 a month, youâ€™d need to make $80,000 a year to be approved. ([Source](https://lifehacker.com/figure-out-how-much-rent-you-can-afford-with-the-40x-ru-1725085955))
* How do I know what I can afford each month?
* How do I pay all my bills?
* How do I pay off debt? 
* How do banks make money? How do I open checking/savings accounts? Why do banks pay out interest?
* What percent of my income should I save each month?
* When should I start investing for retirement? 
  * ASAP! Waiting a few years to start investing can cost hundreds of thousands in the very long term!
* How do I get a good retirement investing rate? (difference between interest compounding times)

**Avoiding Schemes**
* What is a pyramid scheme? How do I know if a program is a pyramid scheme? 
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme
* Payday loans
* Debt payoff calculations
* Military recruitment can be sold as a scam: recruits are told they are getting paid 24/7 and it goes straight to savings. Don't realize they're paid in pebbles and if they went to college/trade school and got a job they would make much more money in 5-6 years than through military. 

**Credit/Credit Cards**
* How do I get a credit card?
  * The first card can be hard to get and you might have to apply to many to get it.
  * Consider department store cards - they are usually easier to get. 
* Why are credit cards "free"? Why do they give so many perks? 
* What is APR? 
* How do I grow my credit scores? 
  * You must have a credit card and use it at least a little bit. From there, the advice on Mint.com or CreditKarma.com is fine. 
* Who cares about a credit score?
  * Credit scores affect every big purchase that you make (car, house, etc), the ability to get new cards, and the size of your credit line. 
* Why do credit unions do? 

**Money concepts:**
* Retirement calculator + compound interest at different times
* How to do taxes online - basics including services like TurboTax and Creditkarma (free!)
* How to run a big bank (know what kind of services to offer and at what cost, to help students know how banks work)

**Basic lesson plan**
Week 1 & 2: Emergency fund - Stuff happens! Car trouble! Dental bills! Rent hikes! Most people don't even expect it when they lose their job. 
* How much money needs to be put away? Two or three months of expenses, so it depends on income and expenses
  * How much does an hourly job make per year? How much income does a person have after tax?
  * What are the biggest expenses for most people? What are hidden expenses? (ask the class to name unexpected expenses)
* Students should be able to conclude that if someone makes X per year they should have Y put away, and that they can do that over time. 
* Explain how nasty payday loans can be if there is time

Week 3 - Income and Expenses continued
* What can I afford? 

Week 4 - Debt, Banks, and Loans
* How do banks work?

Week 5 - Credit, Credit Cards, and Major Purchases

Week 8 - Scams, Scams, Scams
* Likely best to save this for late in the course
