# basic-finance-class

Why do high schools and colleges teach trigonometry, but not basic finances? Let's teach the basics! 
I think this should count as a math core class. We are going to get pretty technically involved. 
I'm not a math teacher, I'm just a guy who thinks that this should be an open sourced initiative.

Open questions we want to answer over the semester: 

* How expensive of an apartment/mortgage can I afford? 
* How do I know what I can afford each month?
* How much should I save each month?
* When should I start investing for retirement? 
* How do I get a good retirement investing rate? (difference between interest compounding times)
