# basic-finance-class

Why do high schools and colleges teach trigonometry, but not basic finances? Students of all demographics graduate and few know how to responsibly manage their money. 

While I have no personal connection to any board of education, I think this should count as a core math class. This project is public domain and anyone can contribute and/or use this cirriculum for any purpose. 

Goals: To teach students the basics of personal finance in a practical and also technical way. 

Open questions that we want to answer over the semester: 
* How expensive of an apartment/mortgage can I afford? 
* How do I know what I can afford each month?
* How do I pay off debt? 
* How much should I save each month?
* How do I do my taxes? (a thin overview of available services)
* When should I start investing for retirement? 
* How do I get a good retirement investing rate? (difference between interest compounding times)

Math concepts:
* Rent affording calculations (I make x, can I afford y?)
* Debt payoff calculations
* Retirement calculator
* How to do taxes online - basics
