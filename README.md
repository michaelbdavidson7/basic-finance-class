# basic-finance-class

Why do high schools and colleges teach trigonometry, but not basic finances? Few students know how to responsibly manage their money, but they know how to solve for x!

While I have no personal connection to any board of education, I think this should count as a core math class. This project is public domain and anyone can contribute and/or use this cirriculum for any purpose. I chose to host this on Github because the path to collaboration is very well defined (see [Github Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)).

**Goal**: To teach students the basics of personal finance in a practical and also technical way. 

**Open questions that we want to answer over the semester:**
* How expensive of an apartment/mortgage can I afford? 
* How do I know what I can afford each month?
* How do I pay all my bills?
* How do I pay off debt? 
* How do banks make money? How do I open checking/savings accounts? Why do banks give interest?
* Why are credit cards "free"? Why do they give so many perks? 
* How do I grow my credit scores? Why do credit unions do? 
* What is a pyramid scheme? How do I know if a program is a pyramid scheme? 
* What percent of my income should I save each month?
* How do I do my taxes? (a thin overview of available services)
* When should I start investing for retirement? 
* How do I get a good retirement investing rate? (difference between interest compounding times)

**Math concepts:**
* Rent affording calculations (I make x, can I afford y?)
* Debt payoff calculations
* Retirement calculator + compound interest at different times
* How to do taxes online - basics including services like TurboTax and Creditkarma (free!)
* How to run a big bank (know what kind of services to offer and at what cost, to help students know how banks work)
